# Class and ID remover

This script will remove unused class and id in your stylesheet

take note:

-   complex selector syntax isn't yet supported.
-   selecting class by heirarchy isn't yet supported

**_using this might break your stylesheet use it in your own risk_**

I will update this soon to support complex selector combinations
